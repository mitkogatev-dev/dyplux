## use the input in main form for quicksearch ports
 eg: select from ports where name like %name%;
 ^!might not work(SQL injection), workaround: select all ports and filther by name;
 then use predefined dashboard func to select by port_ids from inluxdb and show graphs

## Delete graphs from Influx on device or port delete;

## create install.pl 

## Curl and js fetch queries are the same no need to write them twice

## finish curl method

## delete port from dash has no confirm
