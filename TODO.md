### &#x2611; use the input in main form for quicksearch ports
<details>

eg: &#9746; ~~select from ports where name like %name%;~~

&#9746; ~~^!might not work(SQL injection),~~

&#9745; workaround: select all ports and filther by name;

&#9745; then use predefined dashboard func to select by port_ids from inluxdb and show graphs
</details>

## Delete graphs from Influx on device or port delete;

## create install.pl 

## Curl and js fetch queries are the same no need to write them twice

## finish curl method

## delete port from dash has no confirm
